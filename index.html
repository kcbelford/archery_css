          Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with  28
          shooting (14 -  10 yard lanes and 14 â€“ 20 yard lanes) and 2 private coaching
          rooms. We also have access to 26  additional  20 yard lanes  and an outdoor
          shooting field.  We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone
          from the first time archer to the professional archer. Once set up with proper
          fitting equipment, each archer will be given the basic safety instruction to
          start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.
